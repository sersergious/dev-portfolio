#Notes on the project

## Done
- The navigation
- Theme toggling
- Most of the Hero section

## Needs work
- Hero section: stlying, better colors
- Consider removing Daisy UI and replacing any styling with just Tailwind CSS
- Update the theme colors if removing daisy UI
- In the styles folder, identify classes that can be reused, those that can't either leave or delete if they serve no purpose.
